**Course evaluation criteria**

* Exam during lectures (50 points)
* Test during laboratories (50 points)
    * Exam is conducted during the last laboratory. The time to complete the exam is 1.5h (9:50-11:20). Exam file (Jupyter notebook containing set of tasks) will be shared through MS Teams just before the class. Filled notebook should be sent to lkrain@sgh.waw.pl before the deadline (11:20). Exam results will be shared through MS Teams.
* Additional points:
    * Homeworks (1-5 points)
      * Issued both on lectures and laboratories, more details will be added during the semester
    * Modelling competition during laboratories (0-5 points)
      * Competition will be based on classification/regression task with specified metric to optimize (e.g. AUC, RMSE), data will be published just before the start of the class. Competition will be done in groups up to 3 people and any programming language is allowed. Each group should deliver script/notebook with used code and a CSV file with predictions. The best group in each course group will receive 5 points, the second one 4 points, so on. Competition is not mandatory.
    * [Course certificate](https://juliaacademy.com/p/introduction-to-dataframes-jl1) (5 points)
      * Send the course completion certificate to lkrain@sgh.waw.pl
